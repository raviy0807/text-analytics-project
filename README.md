# text-analytics-project
The project discusses the research question ``Is there a relationship between the usage of acronyms in a research paper to the quality of the paper?``. The quality of the paper is being judged by the number of citations it receives. Previous work in the field of citation analysis has focused on analyzing title, introduction, abstract, authorship and length of the research paper and their relation to number of citations. The corpora for the analysis will include research papers published in journals in the field of computer science and marketing respectively. The means of analysis will involve identifying acronyms from the research papers and finding correlation between the ratio of introduced acronyms vs assumed acronyms and number of citations (introduced acronyms are defined by the author and assumed acronyms are more common ones which author doesn't define e.g.`` IoT", `` Tech").
